# TB8 - TINY BASIC FOR PDP8

This is a WIP writing a Tiny BASIC interpreter for the PDP-8 lines of computers. 

In order to learn more about the structure and design of it I'll first write the code in C and then 
step by step translate the C code into PDP-8 assembly. The C is written with the translation in mind 
so it will look a bit odd and will re-implement a many of the library functions that one would normally
have used as plain and simple code in the sources.
